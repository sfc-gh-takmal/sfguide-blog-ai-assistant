###### _Boy Scout Jimmy Adams shares his passion and tips for recycling_

**November 15, 2023** – As the country celebrates [_America Recycles
Day_](https://kab.org/our-signature-programs/america-recycles-day/), Coke
Consolidated is saluting Charlotte-area Boy Scout **Jimmy Adams’** recycling
efforts in his community.

> _“I want to inspire others to Recycle. When we all work together, we can
> make a huge difference.” – Jimmy Adams_

For the past two years, Jimmy has been collecting and sorting used bottles and
cans so they can be made into new bottles and cans. Jimmy regularly stops by
several recycling bins provided by Coca-Cola Consolidated and has collected
more than 550 pounds of plastic bottles and aluminum cans that he’s taken to a
local processor and partner of Coke Consolidated, R3cycle.

Throughout the year, Coke Consolidated collaborates with our customers and
communities to create circular economies and increase the collection and reuse
of packaging.

> “It’s inspiring to hear stories like Jimmy’s,” said Todd Marty, Senior
> Director of Public Affairs and Sustainability. “He is an example of what the
> next generation of diverse servant leaders bring to the table. His
> persistence, hard work, and passion for the environment are wonderful to
> witness, and we appreciate his contributions to help get our bottles and
> cans back to make them into new ones.

Jimmy gave us an inside look into his collection process and shared more about
his passion for recycling and how we can all be a part of protecting and
preserving what matters most – the environment.

## Q: How did you get interested in recycling?

A: **I learned about recycling from my parents and teachers** , and I started
to collect cans, bottles, paper, and other things that can be reused.
Recycling is fun and rewarding, and it makes me feel like I’m making a
difference.

## Q: What inspires you to recycle?

**A** : Recycling helps to save energy, water, and natural resources. By
recycling, we can make new products from old materials, and reduce the amount
of waste that goes to landfills or incinerators. Recycling is good for the
planet and for the people

## Q: What are some of the challenges or difficulties of recycling?

**A: It’s easy to recycle! The most common mistake is people trying to recycle
what they can’t.** Sometimes, it can be hard to find a place to recycle
certain items, especially if they are not accepted by the regular curbside
collection. Another challenge is educating people about the importance of
recycling and encouraging them to do it more often. Some people may not know
how to recycle properly or may not care about the environmental impact of
their actions.

## Q: What are some tips or advice you can give to other people who want to
recycle more?

A: **There are many ways to recycle**. Here are some of my tips:

  * Pay attention to the difference between **trash cans** and **recycling barrels** and respect the difference. Put your trash in the proper place and recycle in its proper place.
  * Check the labels and symbols on the items you buy and look for products that are made from recycled materials, or that can be recycled easily. Coke Consolidated’s bottles and cans are made to be remade.
  * Use reusable bags, bottles, containers, and utensils instead of disposable ones.
  * Compost your food scraps and yard waste or use them as fertilizer for your plants.
  * Join or start a recycling program at your school, workplace, or community, and spread the word about the benefits of recycling.

## Q: What are your plans for the future?

A: **I want to continue recycling and learning more about how to protect the
environment.** I also want to inspire others to do the same, especially my
friends and family. I believe that recycling is not only a habit, but a
lifestyle, and a way to show respect and care for our planet and ourselves.

Jimmy plans on continuing his recycling efforts and aims to empower, educate,
and inspire others to recycle as well. Any financial funds donated or received
from Jimmy’s recycling efforts will be donated to the North Carolina
Firefighters’ Burned Children Fund.

Coke Consolidated remains committed to its sustainability efforts and
empowering the next generation of diverse servant leaders like Jimmy.
