## Coca-Cola Consolidated Implements Closed Loop Recycling at RBC Heritage

Published On: April 21, 2021Categories:
[Sustainability](https://www.cokeconsolidated.com/category/sustainability/)

Sustainability is a top issue and the Company has implemented a Refresh,
Recycle, Renew campaign to promote recycling and closed loop systems. Coke
Consolidated is educating and engaging consumers through customers and asset
partners, and also working with sustainability leaders to launch innovative
programs such as mail-in recycling, city bus recycling pick-up, and micro-
MRFs. Coke Consolidated’s Sustainability Task Force is implementing action
plans for each of its pillars of focus – Package Recovery, Water Leadership,
and Protecting our Climate.

Volunteers from the Bluffton High School football team collected more than 45
yards of aluminum and polyethylene terephthalate plastic (PET) during the
tournament held April 12-18 at Harbour Town Golf Links on Hilton Head Island.
Thanks to a partnership with Clemson University, the University will process
those used bottles and cans so they can be made into new bottles and cans.

In the spring of 2021, Coke Consolidated collaborated with The Heritage
Classic Foundation during the 2021 RBC Heritage to enhance the PGA TOUR golf
tournament’s can and bottle recycling program.

This is just one example of how Coca-Cola Consolidated is committed to working
with partners to launch innovative programs to capture and recycle more
bottles and cans.
