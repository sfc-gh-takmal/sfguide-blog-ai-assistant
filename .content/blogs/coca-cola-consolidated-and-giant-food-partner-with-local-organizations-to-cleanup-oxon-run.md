## Coca-Cola Consolidated and Giant Food Partner with Local Organizations to
Cleanup Oxon Run

[Sustainability](https://www.cokeconsolidated.com/category/sustainability/)

In preparation for Earth Week, Coca-Cola Consolidated and Giant Food held a
community cleanup on Saturday, April 9, where 60 volunteers removed more than
2,000 pounds of waste from the woods and waterways around Oxon Run.

“What an incredible way to usher in Earth Day,” said Altmann Pannell, Director
of Government Relations at Coca-Cola Consolidated. “We couldn’t have asked for
a better partner in Giant Food, who made the weekend such a success.
Sustainability remains a top issue for our Company and our _Refresh, Recycle,
Renew_ initiative is one of the ways we promote recycling and closed loop
systems throughout our territory.”

Coca-Cola Consolidated and Giant partnered with environmental leaders from
Osprey Initiative and Chesapeake Bay Conservancy who navigated the successful
cleanup initiative in Ward 8.

“Osprey Initiative’s mission is to protect and enhance our urban waters. These
small waterways are little blue ways that bring nature much closer to the
public,” said Don Bates, Owner and President of Osprey Initiative. “We were so
excited to have the opportunity to work in our Nation’s Capital and truly
appreciate the support of our sponsors.”

The cleanup was a community effort attended by local legislators and
volunteers from US Dream Academy, students from the University of Maryland,
and fraternity brothers from Georgetown’s Sigma Phi Epsilon.

Coca-Cola Consolidated and Giant held a reception after the cleanup where five
lucky volunteers walked home with $200 Giant gift cards. Volunteers also
received catered meals and beverages provided by Giant, Coca-Cola
Consolidated, as well as with other giveaways.

“Giant was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1936, and we understand how
important it is to keep our communities and National Parks clean,” said Daniel
Wolk, External Communications and Community Relations Manager at Giant Food.
“We are proud to have teamed-up with our close partners in the environmental
initiative of cleaning up waste in our Nation’s Capital.”
