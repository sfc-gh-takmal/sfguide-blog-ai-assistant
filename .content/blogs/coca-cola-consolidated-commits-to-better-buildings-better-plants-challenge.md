## Coca-Cola Consolidated Commits to Better Buildings’ “Better Plants
Challenge”

Published On: October 18, 2022Categories:
[Sustainability](https://www.cokeconsolidated.com/category/sustainability/)

In cooperation with Better Buildings’ “Better Plants Challenge,” Coca-Cola
Consolidated has committed to reducing the Company’s energy use ratio **20%**
**by 2028**. Energy reduction projects implemented to date include:

  * Upgraded to LED lighting at 9 of 11 manufacturing locations.
  * Modernized can and bottle fillers in 3 plants to increase energy/water efficiency.
  * Enhanced production planning that includes longer run times, fewer clean-in-place rinses, and cold clean-in-place rinses to reduce energy and rinse time.
  * Light-weighting 12oz bottles and caps for all locations, resulting in less material waste and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
  * Installation of blow mold bottle production at select facilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions created by shipping empty bottles.
  * Transitioned trash compactors at all 11 production facilities to Waste-to-Energy Incinerators, preventing 487 tons of greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere while creating 198 MWh of renewable energy – enough to power 19 homes for a year.

In 2023, Consolidated plans to add an additional blow mold line and new can
and bottle fillers to continue lowering our carbon footprint.
