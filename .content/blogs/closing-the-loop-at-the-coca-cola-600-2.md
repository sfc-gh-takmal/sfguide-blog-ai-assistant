## Closing the Loop at the Coca-Cola 600

Published On: May 28, 2021Categories:
[Sustainability](https://www.cokeconsolidated.com/category/sustainability/)

We collected empty bottles and cans the weekend of the Coca-Cola 600 at
Charlotte Motor Speedway. Since our bottles and cans are made to be remade we
worked with local recycling organizations to ensure we got every bottle back.

efforts](https://www.cokeconsolidated.com/sustainability).
