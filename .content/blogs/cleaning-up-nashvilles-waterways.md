## Cleaning up Nashville’s Waterways

Published On: March 31, 2023Categories:
[Sustainability](https://www.cokeconsolidated.com/category/sustainability/)

Coca-Cola Consolidated partnered with [Mill Creek Watershed
Association](https://www.millcreekwatershedassociation.org/) and [Osprey
Initiative](https://osprey.world/) to remove litter in and around Nashville’s
Antioch Park.

More than 30 volunteers, including Coke Consolidated teammates, joined the
effort. Bottles collected from the cleanup will be recycled and remade into
new bottles.

Water is the main ingredient in the beverages we bottle and we pledge to
protect every drop. Coca-Cola Consolidated is protecting waterways, like those
in Antioch Park, in communities served across its territory.
