For the 149th running of the Kentucky Derby, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Kroger
and Churchill Downs are teaming up to recycle bottles and cans from this
year’s race.

Fans will have opportunities to recycle at Churchill Downs during this year’s
races and Kroger’s Zero Hunger Zero Waste team will be on site with gift cards
for those who are caught green handed recycling bottles and cans.  

This partnership will help collect used bottles and cans to be remade into new
packaging.
