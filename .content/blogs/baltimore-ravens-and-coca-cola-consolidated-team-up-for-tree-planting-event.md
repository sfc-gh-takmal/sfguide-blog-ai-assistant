## Baltimore Ravens and Coke Consolidated Team Up for Tree-Planting Event

###### _Volunteers helped restore and beautify Chinquapin Park  _

On Monday, October 30, the Baltimore Ravens, Safeway and Coca-Cola
Consolidated partnered with Baltimore City Recreation and Parks to host a
tree-planting event at Baltimore’s Chinquapin Park.  

Ravens players, cheerleaders, and mascot Poe joined Coca-Cola teammates and
the Coca-Cola Consolidated Response Team to steward existing trees and plant
new ones in the park. More than 50 volunteers cut back invasive plants that
were harming the current tree growth and planted new trees to enhance the
park’s beauty and biodiversity.

> “I am just so grateful to have an experience like this,” said Aaron Bell,
> Coca-Cola Consolidated’s General Manager of Sales and Operations in
> Baltimore. “We’re doing this work so these folks in the community can
> continue to enjoy the park for years to come.”

The event concluded with a community celebration featuring food trucks and
giveaways for the residents of the nearby neighborhood. The volunteers
received lunches provided by Safeway, the official grocery partner of the
Baltimore Ravens.

> “We are grateful for the opportunity to be in the Baltimore community and to
> make positiveimpact alongside our partners. The actions taken by these
> volunteers will support tree growth for years to come” said Ravens vice
> president of community relations Heather Darney.

Coca-Cola Consolidated is Baltimore’s local Coca-Cola bottler. We’re dedicated
to making a positive difference in the communities where our teammates live
and work, through initiatives such as water leadership, package recovery, and
climate protection.

The tree-planting event at Chinquapin Park was a great example of how the
Ravens and Coca-Cola Consolidated worked together to make Baltimore a greener
and cleaner place to live.
